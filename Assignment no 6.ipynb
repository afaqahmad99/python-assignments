    "## Ans: Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.Object oriented Programming is based on the principles of polymorphism, abstraction, inheritance and encapsulation. In Object Oriented Programming we can solve real world problems.\n"
